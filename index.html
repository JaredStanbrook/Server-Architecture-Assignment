          The Purpose of this website is to act as a portfolio for my creative work, I’ve chosen this medium to present my portfolio as it allows wide accessibility of my work to anyone who wish to see it, some important needs that the website must address include, it must be able to present my work in an appealing way that makes each piece stand exclusively from one another. The website will provide the ability to contact me through links to my social accounts, as well a description of who I am as an artist. Following W3C web design standards will allow the website to be easily navigated and accessible to anyone, as well as using current design standards to convey to the user my work as being professional and bold.
          <br><br>
          The design of the webpage will include one landing page, which will be the statement of the whole website to reel in users, on this page there will be links to subpages that present each artwork in its own personal light. Ability to change contrast of the webpage will improve accessibility of the website, while sticking to the overall design of the webpage. Each page will follow the same colour schemes and layout to keep it consistent throughout the website, A menu will open over the whole page when the user wants to jump to a different page with a click of a button.          
          <br><br>
          At the centre of the website is its Content Management System (CMS), this will allow changes to the website to be made effortlessly and keep my portfolio current to my latest work I’ve created and to update previous works, this will make updating content on the website much easier to be performed.
